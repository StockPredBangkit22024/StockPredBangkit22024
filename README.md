**StockPred** is a stock price prediction tool that uses Deep Neural Network (DNN) machine learning technology to assist investors in optimizing their investment portfolios. This applicationâ€™s stock price prediction model incorporates macroeconomic parameters such as the USD/IDR exchange rate, Bank Indonesia (BI) interest rates, and inflation rates as independent variables. The primary goal of this program is to deliver more accurate and insightful forecasts, allowing investors to make better choices in the face of market swings.

The investigation focused on 20 stocks listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). Machine learning technology was incorporated into the application development process, and cloud computing via Google Cloud services was employed to support storage requirements, model training, and Android implementation as the primary user interface. 

Furthermore, the primary goal of this application is to address the demand for more accurate stock prediction tools for investors by considering the dynamics of macroeconomic elements. Thus, this program is intended to be a valuable solution for economic empowerment via investment portfolio optimization. **StockPred** is designed to give practical advantages to investors confronting market volatility difficulties, including improved decision making.
